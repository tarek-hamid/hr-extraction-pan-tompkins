The following functions are used to compute heart rate using the Pan-Tompkins algorithm. 
Please find more background information here: www.github.com/tarek-hamid/hr-extraction-pan-tompkins

Derivative and square functions are separated into their own functions despite using numpy packages as additional measures can be used to make the
calculations more robust.
